Hello!  You are viewing the documentation for **GitSlice**.  This documentation has been automatically generated using
Sphinx as part of a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.  It is hosted using GitLab Pages on my private GitLab instance.

You should start at the `module index <https://gitslice.dylanwilson.dev/py-modindex.html>`_ to see all the modules in
GitSlice.  For the source code, including the
`.gitlab-ci.yml <https://gitlab.dylanwilson.dev/qub/csc4006-project/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml>`_. file which generated
this site, have a look at the `GitLab repository <https://gitlab.dylanwilson.dev/qub/csc4006-project>`_.

These docs are generated using docstrings at the top of each the functions of GitSlice.
